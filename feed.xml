    Amplified IT I, II, Sec | CCNA, CCENT, CMNO | MTA | GCP
<br>
<br>Welcome to my site. It’s a work in progress. I’m slowly releasing my private documentation library for public use on complex and beginner topics to help those where documentation fell short.
<br>
<br>Topics will include Cloud Architecting, DevOps, NetOps, and Systems administration. I may even post a few times about management and navigating challenges as a Director of Technology.
<br>
<br>Follow along, G.

<p>No, seriously though, the installation is almost that brief as well. We used PiVPN (Raspberry Pi - VPN) don't worry, it took me a minute to understand the name as well, which is why I broke it down for you. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Look, I know what you're thinking - "Why provide a link?". Because you're going to screw it up. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=strict&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS847US847&amp;ei=poMRXcyUBI-5tQah0LfwAw&amp;q=openvpn+raspbian+download&amp;oq=openvpn+raspbian+download&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i22i30l2.3465.4800..4895...0.0..0.204.1294.0j7j1......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0j0i20i263j33i299j33i160.hI7ExZrX0nk">Le Googles'</a> offers the first three searches for the SD card users... we are installing this in a Hyper Visor scenario. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:separator {"opacity":"css"} --></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>
<!-- /wp:separator --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>2. Next, you'll need to find yourself a host machine with a VM manager on it.  I used Hyper-V offered by Microsoft on their Windows Server 2012 R2 Data-center installation (I know, it's 2019, but that's what I have). </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:separator {"opacity":"css"} --></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator has-css-opacity"/>
<!-- /wp:separator --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>3. Frankly, if I need to explain this part to you, you probably shouldn't be using a hyper-visor just from a security standpoint, so I'm only going to point out the obvious for those who want a quick and dirty installation. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<ul>
<li>50GB HDD</li>
<li>ISO of Raspbian </li>

<li>2GB of RAM (Again, you only need 512MB, but speed)</li>
<li>1st Gen Network Adapter (virtual, obviously)</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Launch your VM</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Boot to ISO (The image you downloaded from Step 1)</li>
<li>Follow prompts to install Raspbian (INSTALL!!!!)</li>
<li>After installation, reboot, and then install updates (apt-get upgrade | update) </li>

<p>5. Time to get dirty. Open the terminal, and use this launch code: </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash</code></pre>
<p>
<!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You will then, spam "enter". Seriously, just follow the prompts to finalize the configuration (mostly "enter") </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Reboot. </p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>&nbsp;(<em><u>efficiently expressed - rhetorically</u></em>); Reducing infrastructure hardware with virtualization technology and picking energy efficient hardware that ultimately reduced our energy consumption over the last six years. Certainly beating the annual increase on commercial energy costs and giving us insights into the power of software and hardware technology innovations.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>This project is:&nbsp;</strong>My measurements are a 'broad stroke' of what our potential savings were. We want to see if we A) saved money on electricity to lower the environmental impact and B) see if my operational planning is lowering our foot print, and requiring less of a demand on internal resources ($$$$) and operating more efficiently (this is what I really care about).</p>
<p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/49/0" alt="Infrastructure Energy Consumption Analysis" /></figure>
<p>
<!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Well... I think the graph speaks for itself. We saved a lot of money on electricity. How did we do it? Keep reading.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>--</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>What this analysis could have been:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It could have been a complete analysis that broke down each system by CPU (E3, E5, AMD, etc..), RAM (8, 16, 32, 64, 128), Storage (RAID configs based on SSD's, HDD's), and exact amount of (network) data pushed by the hour. Gratefully, I get paid more than $0.082 per hour, unfortunately, that means that the time to perform a fully detailed analysis may dramatically reduce the cost savings.&nbsp;Then again, it could be tucked away as a hidden variable..., jk.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Remember, efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><u>"When products use more power to perform the same amount of work, they are by definition less efficient."</u></em></p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>--</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Why it wasn't that:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Cost benefit analysis i.e, not worth the time for a similar outcome. This analysis is being done in hindsight with 20/20 vision. If I wanted to make a decision about future infrastructure changes (collocation, hybrid public cloud, on-prem datacenter expansions) with vendor purchase agreements over $100,000 for a single refresh, then the cost/benefit may be exponential enough to measure.&nbsp;We don't spend that type of money on infrastructure.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>--</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>What it is:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I mean, knowing that the new hardware consumes less wattage than the prior hardware and comes with software that supports low idle usage during low load times; means that the power consumption will be lower - in theory. But remember, all you know are the stats given to you from the vendor. That doesn't include the environment variables (seasonal electrical cost changes, systems usage changes, and random implementations or deprecation's, nor system count changes).&nbsp;<em><u>That sentence alone is exhaustive and makes me want to switch to cloud computing</u></em>! For instance, our year over year costs per device is on an upward trend, but our overall costs for our environment is on a downward trend. How is that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/49/0" alt="year over year electricity cost per device" /></figure>
<p>
<!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Originally, I wanted to see how much of a cost savings or increase we would see from my infrastructure decisions. It quickly became apparent that most of my savings was not because I picked super efficient and 'green' hardware -&nbsp;<em><u>but I did.</u></em>&nbsp;The primary reason for my cost savings was actually a software technology - virtualization.&nbsp;<em><u>Yes. It has been around for a LONG TIME.</u></em></p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The primary savings was accomplished during the partial and full virtualization phase (2016-2017). Reducing the onsite datacenter footprint from 24 servers down to 3 primary servers. Unfortunately, some of the technologies deployed required additional power consumption, increased demand on average server usage and increased PoE demand on all switches as more devices become Powered over Ethernet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong><em><u>Eitherway, we dramatically reduced our energy consumption! Yay, us. Sorry, Entergy.</u></em></strong></p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>What I plan to do with this:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Increase system efficiency, cost effectively - I thought I made that clear.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The primary bottleneck that is limiting our system throughput are the disks I/O speeds. With future analysis, we will be able to determine if SSD's can provide us with an operational cost savings through the direct cost of electricity, infrastructure purchasing costs by consolidating one of the Hyper visors from three down to two and comparing those cost savings to varying models. I'm considering and testing costs in both a hybrid-cloud infrastructure (which adds systemic processes (lowers efficiency)) and complexes the design (lowers troubleshooting efficiency without proper training) and increases demand for professional development. All variables must be considered before making a decision on our next infrastructure initiative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>How I plan to measure:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Electrical costs can continue to be measured on an annual basis by kWh per device based on average load/usage and multiplied by the total number of 'like' devices in the network.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Processes can be measured by taking the collective salary average and dividing it by the support hours required to maintain, monitor, and support a hybrid-cloud.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In the same light, troubleshooting time can be averaged by the salary over ticket completion times for systems / infrastructure tasks.&nbsp;</li>
<li>And finally, PD costs are explicit when utilizing subscription plans, boot-camps, and training materials. The hardest aspect to measure will be personal, off-the-clock training time dedicated to increasing our staff knowledge on cloud computing maintenance and troubleshooting.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>2. Optics - Slower interface speeds could easily cost a solution 10%. With new silicon photonics reaching 400G, the cost per bit can be driven down.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With the hardware becoming more diverse and software driven, we are now going to see an increase in cost on the speed. </p>

<p>Can you imagine? 400GbE connections. That's an insane amount of data movement. </p>

<p>3. Software -  As Cisco references Silicon as the car, they reference Software as the steering wheel. Their Network Operating System (NOS) becomes an even more critical component in the future of the internet. With Cisco's IOS XR7, come prioritization on operations. Their goal was to simplify and improve automation tasks with the overarching goal of "zero-touch". With better efficiencies, comes more complexities. XR7 NOS allows teams to utilize the computer for insights and analytics. </p>

<p>Unifi for Home use is amazing when you combine the Security Gateway with any of their switches. Getting the live dashboard and alerts with their "insights" dashboard is an amazing feature. 100% worth the cost (<a href="https://store.ui.com/products/unifi-security-gateway">$139</a>). </p>

<p><strong>The Excel sheet </strong>- I use it "planning" and being pro-active with my budgeting efforts. What I mean by this is, I plan purchasing a home, funding a college account for my future child, purchasing a car, or planning future investments. It's sort of like a quick simulation. </p>

<p>Just start filling it out based on a monthly view and allow excel to "summarize" it for you. Do the same for your expenses and see how much is left in the ("Net(+/-)) column at the end of the month. </p>
<p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On to <strong>the App</strong>! This is what everyone wants to see. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":813,"sizeSlug":"large"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-813"><img loading="lazy" src="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/46/primary-og-image.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/46/responsive/primary-og-image-xs.jpg 300w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/46/responsive/primary-og-image-sm.jpg 480w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/46/responsive/primary-og-image-md.jpg 768w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/46/responsive/primary-og-image-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/46/responsive/primary-og-image-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/46/responsive/primary-og-image-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt=""  /></figure></figure>

<p>So, yeah, it does a lot - but it keeps things simple. My favorite feature about the application, aside from being able to view all accounts at once (Student loans, home loans, credit/debit, and 403b accounts), I'm able to view my "net worth" because of the vast account capabilities. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The other cool feature, is the ability to categorize. Throughout the month, I set a dollar amount budget (based on my monthly excel budget) and I categorize all expenses throughout the month. By the end of the month, I look at the budget dashboard and see where I am with my budget categories. Most of the time, I've over spent on restaurants or groceries, or wood working projects. I promise, one of these days, I'll treat wood working like a business and actually make money from it! </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The unspoken and indirect feature that Personal Capital offers, is the ability to reflect. I was feeling a little negative toward my finances - feeling as if I hadn't made any progress in the last year. Personal Capital maintains record of all transactions and net worth... when I reflected on the app, I saw that I actually paid down $20,000 worth of debt, saved for a mortgage down payment, paid off my car and enjoyed an expensive vacation for a week in Florida... It instantly boosted my mood and made me realize that I am making steady progress on my financial, material and social goals. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<!-- /wp:separator --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The second App - Robinhood. If you're investing but don't have more than $200,000 invested in a stock trading brokerage account, then I suggest that you invest for free - in Robinhood. Seriously, you can make money instantly with their free trades. Buy Apple today, sell it in a few days and enjoy your 1-3% profit margins. If you capitalize on this technique which leverages compounding growth and the market continues to do well, you'll do well! </p>
<p>

<p>It has been exactly four weeks since Homeland Security, the National Guard and LA DoE scheduled an emergency phone conference with all Technology Directors in the state of Louisiana.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>During this briefing, we were informed that 6 school districts and 2 government agencies were attacked by a ransomware known as <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/">RYUK</a>. The immediate reaction was frightening as the governor of Louisiana demanded a state of emergency. We were told to shut down internet access and remove local admin rights until further notice.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Keep in mind, we were two weeks out from the start of school (smart timing on RYUK). We had to finish deployments for hundreds of chrome books, projector installations, finalize surveillance installs and manage several other projects in our department.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A day passed before we received a strategic game plan from Homeland Security that detailed several phases of security implementations. Phase 1, turn off all internet access.  This can be hard to do when your trying to deploy devices, run updates and have 150 staff members coming back to campus...</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'll explain the technologies and how everything works later in the blog.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We spent a week tightening up the ship, blocking internet access based on firewall rules, attempting to have offsite backups work, deploying devices, installing software... we were extremely reliant on the internet.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Services were breaking constantly, as expected when you turn off the internet (LOL, if I don't laugh, I'm crying). My boss could see the stress on our department and offered full support to us while we navigated these high seas. I have to say, I have one of the most supportive bosses in the world (Shout out)!</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>She granted the additional resources necessary to tackle this oncoming storm.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Four weeks later, 600+ hours between two employees, we now have all systems patched, removed local admin, wiped and deployed. In addition, all members of our organization have been trained on identifying phishing attacks (<a href="https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/">for your reference</a>). And the entire network is locked down according to recommendations made by Homeland Security. </p>

<p><strong>How we "turned off" the internet</strong></p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using the firewall "deny any any" and manually adding 40+ pages of "trusted" ip addresses was not an option for us. It was extremely time consuming and impractical. I often fat-fingered IP and port numbers. I broke everything. I wish Meraki allowed me to use a CLI for this type of task. Luckily, Meraki had a second option for us. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Meraki offers Content Filtering, which allows you to blacklist everything (*) and whitelist URL's. I chose this option. Upon blacklisting the entire internet with (*), I was then able to whitelist common sites much more efficiently. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Anything that ends with .gov and .edu were whitelisted, but not completely. Aside from these, every other site had to be whitelisted. Aside from the constant adding, this process is very easy. </p>
<p>

<p>All traffic is triple filtered with the leading Cisco, Google, and Meraki products in the globe. With dual content filtering, IPS/IDS and AMP screening, our traffic has been relatively clean - to say the least.  </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When it comes to Meraki, we were also able to filter traffic by country. This allowed us to block traffic from random countries that we have no business communicating with/through. </p>

<p>As of today, we are not in the clear, but we are in a much better state now than we were a month ago. We were given the chance to reflect on our current policies, enforce new procedures and tighten up security campus wide. Other organizations were not given the same opportunity as us. </p>

<p>I'm going to keep this one short, like most of my posts. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Knowledge Curve signifies the "possibility" of knowledge if someone were to have consistent and focused study throughout their life versus the typical life long learner that prefers a more sporadic approach - which is provoked by work demands or life changes. There's no shame in learning as you go from a career perspective, but you can change your outlook on learning exponentially by having a more consistent approach to learning. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The key here is that you're not "resetting" by allowing your brain an unnecessary break (several month's or years). I specifically remember the first time that I obtained my CCNA. I had all of the textbook knowledge crammed in my brain, I was confident, and then I decided to stop labbing and maintaining my knowledge after passing my exam. Three years later, I have to renew my CCNA and progress onto the CCNP - but I lost a lot of the knowledge because I have not been using it in a practical manner. There's a way to prevent this from happening to you. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Stay maintained and continue learning. It's a life long venture; not a 5k race. Reading one topic a day for three years would have kept me on cusp of knowledge in the world of CCNA and honestly, it would have promoted me to learn CCNP before my renewal date... So now, I'm stuck renewing my CCNA again before I can even progress onto the CCNP. That's not because of a limitation set by Cisco, but rather the inherent need to relearn all of the information that I put on the back burner three years ago... </p>
