<p>I attended a Cyber Security and Fraud conference today with special agent Eric in the white collar crimes division in New Orleans. It was very insightful to learn about our immediate attacks and pressures.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To start, there are countries are countries with written agendas to target countries like ours (USA). With bankers tightening their security and protocols for handling their processes, its now forcing the hackers and criminals to move their operations directly to the client(s). It's great that banking institutions are cracking down on security (passwords, encrypted communications, malware/adware/ransomware detectors and scanners and phishing simulations).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With the immediate threat coming from foreign internationals, security agencies like the CIA, FBI and local police need to move quickly to identify and target these criminals. $350,000,000 was criminally taken through the banking system (I believe only in Louisiana), with 76% of which being recovered. That's a great number recovered! At the same time, there's a lot of money that was not recovered!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The FBI set up <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx">https://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx</a> for community members to report suspected criminal activity. The quicker you report, the quicker they can deploy their task forces to combat the criminals.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator"><!-- /wp:separator -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Don't let this overwhelm you, there are preventative measures that you can take to help combat these issues. One, keep all systems patched and updated - especially Windows environments. Two, training is the second best effort to protecting your data. The majority of criminals are allowed access (Directly/Indirectly) through email spoofing and spearheading. This means that they breach your account or a vendor and then monitor the accounts for months. Once they feel that they are ready, they are then able to "mimic" your rhetoric and attack others in your contacts list.</p>

<p>Today, I'm starting my journey for the CCNP v2 R&amp;S.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm learning about the different Routing connections (<em>Building Access, Building Distribution, Campus backbones</em>, etc..). I'm glad to know that my campus is actually set up like their suggestions, with the exception of two buildings.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Knowing more, I now see where I may add a building distribution switch to limit the number of fiber connections running back to the core, but also increase feasibility of troubleshooting fewer switches in the long run.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator"><!-- /wp:separator -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Topics that I need to remember or work on the most:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Routing Protocols
<ul>
<li>RIP - Distance-Vector</li>
<li>EIGRP (Advanced) Distance-Vector</li>
<li>OSPF - Link-State</li>
<li>IS-IS - Link-State</li>
<li>BGP - Path-Vector</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All routing protocols are currently IGP (Interior Gateway Protocols) except for BGP, which is an EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The second topic that I need to focus on is Split-Horizon and Poison Reverse.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>Split-Horizon</em> is the feature that prevents a route learned on one interface from being advertised through the same interface again. (CH.1)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The <em>Poison Reverse </em>feature causes a route received on the same interface to be advertised back out, however, it uses a metric of "<em>infinite</em>".</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The third important technology emphasized in this chapter were the different network traffic types.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Unicast - <em>One to One</em></li>
<li>Broadcast - <em>One to Many</em></li>
<li>Multicast - <em>One to Many</em>, but specific</li>
<li>Anycast - IPv6 only, assigned to multiple devices for One to <em>Nearest</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, I have to say, I'm really enjoying "Cloud my Lab". They finally got my instance (Pod) up and running about 72 hours after my payment processed.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To get into the server, all I had to do was RDP in using my Windows RDP client and the provided IP and user credentials. Once I was in, I had all of the images pre-loaded and GNS3 configured for my first project.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For $30, I have to say, it's totally worth it! Sure, it's a convenience fee, but their technical staff stand ready to help with any trouble that I have.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In addition, I don't have to worry about finding the best ios files and go through the hassle of uploading them. Also, this environment can be operated from a Chromebook RDP window app... that's pretty convenient! I'll create more posts later as I build out my lab environments and test additional features.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I found out today that my instance, "Pod", only has 4GB of RAM while my subscription is currently set to "Tiny" which supports 8GB of RAM... I decided to upgrade to a "Small" instance because I noticed a little lag when I launched my text editor "Atom.io", after doing so, I checked the CPU and RAM from the system properties and noticed that I was not getting the level of service that I paid for during my original subscription period. I've contacted their support and they are working diligently to resolve my issue.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm very excited to have the full 8vCPU's and 16GB of RAM! I may even use this system for remote testing VPNs and ICMP from outside of my network.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Edit #2: This is what matters...</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I was completely wrong about the configuration and setup over there at Cloud My Lab. After discovering that my host machine only had 4GB of RAM allocated, I contacted support to get it fixed. With the $30/mnth "Tiny" package, you should be getting 8GB RAM. Each time I started a text editor or web browwser, the CPU and RAM would spike! So I was a little frustrated.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After communicating with support, they explained that the GNS3 hosted instance gets the 8GB RAM remotely and that the Windows Host that you RDP into only gets the 4GB... This made a lot of sense once it was explained. It certainly explained the reason for the Windows Host maxing resources while the GNS3 Host continued to respond perfectly fine.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Today, I'm installing <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible </a>on my Mac...</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For Mac, you need to install pip, which is done by following the instructions provided by <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, which didn't work for me, so I found an easier command:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ sudo easy_install pip</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With that command, I was able to make it to the next phase... which didn't work. At this point, I was very frustrated! After deciding to read all of the <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html?extIdCarryOver=true&amp;sc_cid=701f2000001OH7YAAW#latest-releases-via-pip">instructions on Ansible</a>, I found a paragraph regarding MacOS <a href="https://support.apple.com/downloads/mavericks"> 10.9</a> . Well, I was running <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1994?locale=en_US">10.14</a>. It obviously inherited its <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bitchiness">bitchiness </a>from<a href="https://support.apple.com/downloads/mavericks"> 10.9</a>. So, I ran the command:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments pip install --user ansible</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All problems were solved. At this point, I'm considering a degree in Linux based systems so that I can actually understand this shit. But no, I'm going to continue my path toward the <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/expert/ccie-routing-switching.html">#CCIE</a> and <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/architect/ccar.html">#CCAr</a>!</p>

<p>Well, today is one year too late. I really feel like I've been abusing myself by not taking care of my RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury), which has now formed into carpal tunnel.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Between my daily commute where I put pressure on the wrist, the 8+ hour work days where I hold my mouse improperly, and the additional time on the computer at home has taken a toll on my right arm and wrist.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now of course, this is a self diagnosis. I have not spoken to a trained professional, except for my family friend who is a licensed chiropractor. She has guided me for several months, reducing the strain on my wrist nearly 80%! This is huge. However, it's still unbearable. I'm currently scheduling doctor visits with our local "Hand Center of Louisiana" to get my wrist checked out.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'm feeling nervous, but less than I was eight months ago. I decided to postpone this procedure because I thought that it would take several months of recovery. After speaking with a colleague , it's now apparent that I will be able to recover within two hours, functional recovery in four days and complete recovery within three months. That's not bad.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you're experiencing pains in your wrist please consider getting ergonomic equipment such as a standing desk, vertical mouse, and standing desk! If you do not want to stand then invest in a proper chair that can support your body type with the option of adjusting between 90 and 130 degrees to allow for proper blood flow.</p>

<p>Seriously, take care of yourself. Invest in proper equipment, good food, and study materials!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Edit: I visited a doctor to undergo extended rehab. We identified about eight (8) areas of concern that have all lead to the issues in my arm and wrist. Seriously, starting in my ankles, progressing through the hips and through the spine... Please, spend the time to take care of yourself with daily stretching and ergonomic checkups. Doing this can help you avoid serious irreversible damage to your body.</p>

<p>I have to say, <a href="https://github.com/jimradford/superputty">SuperPuTTY </a>is amazing. I wish I could justify the purchase of <a href="https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/">SecureCRT</a>, but for now, <a href="https://github.com/jimradford/superputty">SuperPuTTY </a>is the winner.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Before you head over to the <a href="https://github.com/jimradford/superputty">SuperPuTTY distro on GitHub</a>, you will need to make sure that you have <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">Putty downloaded</a> to your computer. I like using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows">Windows</a> as my primary workstation, but I may change it to a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">Mac Book Pro</a> within the next year. You know, it's the whole debate between - should I put a down payment on a house or buy a Mac... Tough decision. I think I need to phone in <a href="https://www.daveramsey.com/">Dave Ramsey</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Anyways, you will download the .exe of Putty and then download SuperPuTTY (do you know what TTY stands for?). Once you have the .zip downloaded, you will extract it and run SuperPuTTY. SuperPuTTY will then prompt you to point the core installation to the Putty .exe. I store mine in <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a> so that I can automatically backup all of my sessions and maintain a single location for all things Putty.</p>

<p>If you need help understanding all of the input information required to start a PuTTY session, then you're not ready to start with PuTTY - <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=newb">newb</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>BUT, let me know and I'd be happy to get you up to pace. I was a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=newb">newb </a>once. Now I'm an expert.</p>

<p>Sure, it was probably purchased because of its direct representation of me as a grumpy - know it all (No-It-All), but I also feel like it may have been purchased because of my tender fluffiness... I'm not totally sure, and I'm not going to ask.</p>
