<p>It has been exactly four weeks since Homeland Security, the National Guard and LA DoE scheduled an emergency phone conference with all Technology Directors in the state of Louisiana.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>During this briefing, we were informed that 6 school districts and 2 government agencies were attacked by a ransomware known as <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/">RYUK</a>. The immediate reaction was frightening as the governor of Louisiana demanded a state of emergency. We were told to shut down internet access and remove local admin rights until further notice.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Keep in mind, we were two weeks out from the start of school (smart timing on RYUK). We had to finish deployments for hundreds of chrome books, projector installations, finalize surveillance installs and manage several other projects in our department.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A day passed before we received a strategic game plan from Homeland Security that detailed several phases of security implementations. Phase 1, turn off all internet access. This can be hard to do when your trying to deploy devices, run updates and have 150 staff members coming back to campus...</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'll explain the technologies and how everything works later in the blog.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We spent a week tightening up the ship, blocking internet access based on firewall rules, attempting to have offsite backups work, deploying devices, installing software... we were extremely reliant on the internet.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Services were breaking constantly, as expected when you turn off the internet (LOL, if I don't laugh, I'm crying). My boss could see the stress on our department and offered full support to us while we navigated these high seas. I have to say, I have one of the most supportive bosses in the world (Shout out)!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>She granted the additional resources necessary to tackle this oncoming storm.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Four weeks later, 600+ hours between two employees, we now have all systems patched, removed local admin, wiped and deployed. In addition, all members of our organization have been trained on identifying phishing attacks (<a href="https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/">for your reference</a>). And the entire network is locked down according to recommendations made by Homeland Security.</p>

<p>They have identified RDP (3389) and Email (80/443) as the two primary vectors of initiation.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"><!-- /wp:separator -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>How we "turned off" the internet</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using the firewall "deny any any" and manually adding 40+ pages of "trusted" ip addresses was not an option for us. It was extremely time consuming and impractical. I often fat-fingered IP and port numbers. I broke everything. I wish Meraki allowed me to use a CLI for this type of task. Luckily, Meraki had a second option for us.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Meraki offers Content Filtering, which allows you to blacklist everything (*) and whitelist URL's. I chose this option. Upon blacklisting the entire internet with (*), I was then able to whitelist common sites much more efficiently.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Anything that ends with .gov and .edu were whitelisted, but not completely. Aside from these, every other site had to be whitelisted. Aside from the constant adding, this process is very easy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All traffic is triple filtered with the leading Cisco, Google, and Meraki products in the globe. With dual content filtering, IPS/IDS and AMP screening, our traffic has been relatively clean - to say the least.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When it comes to Meraki, we were also able to filter traffic by country. This allowed us to block traffic from random countries that we have no business communicating with/through.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Anti-virus</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We commissioned a new AI based product to help protect all of our servers, faculty and staff. Hoping that their spread of knowledge with the recent attacks will help prevent attacks on our network.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Advanced email filtering &amp; quarantines</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Google allows for us to enable advanced email filtering and quarantine. I've enabled all features to flag suspicious emails and I've personally trained every employee on proper email usage and what to look for in an email.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator"><!-- /wp:separator -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As of today, we are not in the clear, but we are in a much better state now than we were a month ago. We were given the chance to reflect on our current policies, enforce new procedures and tighten up security campus wide. Other organizations were not given the same opportunity as us.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For anyone out there battling this, please reach out if you need support. This is a beast to navigate and cyber crimes are not going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>I'm going to keep this one short, like most of my posts.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Knowledge Curve signifies the "possibility" of knowledge if someone were to have consistent and focused study throughout their life versus the typical life long learner that prefers a more sporadic approach - which is provoked by work demands or life changes. There's no shame in learning as you go from a career perspective, but you can change your outlook on learning exponentially by having a more consistent approach to learning.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The key here is that you're not "resetting" by allowing your brain an unnecessary break (several month's or years). I specifically remember the first time that I obtained my CCNA. I had all of the textbook knowledge crammed in my brain, I was confident, and then I decided to stop labbing and maintaining my knowledge after passing my exam. Three years later, I have to renew my CCNA and progress onto the CCNP - but I lost a lot of the knowledge because I have not been using it in a practical manner. There's a way to prevent this from happening to you.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Stay maintained and continue learning. It's a life long venture; not a 5k race. Reading one topic a day for three years would have kept me on cusp of knowledge in the world of CCNA and honestly, it would have promoted me to learn CCNP before my renewal date... So now, I'm stuck renewing my CCNA again before I can even progress onto the CCNP. That's not because of a limitation set by Cisco, but rather the inherent need to relearn all of the information that I put on the back burner three years ago...</p>

<p>Creating VLANs is an easy task, but you may run into issues with the VLANs populating between the other access switches (VTP : Client).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Option One</strong> (used to create the VLAN)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>**Option One**(config)#vlan 10(config-vlan)#name SALES&amp;**Option Two** (config)#interface vlan 10(config-if)#description SALES(config-if)#ip address a.b.c.d x.x.x.x</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Option two allows you to set a static interface for IP routing. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator"><!-- /wp:separator -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For <strong>EXTENDED </strong>VLANs(1006-4096), VTP mode must be in Transparent. Server mode should throw errors, probably not in IOL devices.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>(config)#vtp mode transparent</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:separator --></p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator"><!-- /wp:separator -->
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By default all cisco catalysts come preconfigured with VTP server mode. You will need to change this on all access switches not serving vlans. First,</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>(config)#vtp mode Serveror(config)#vtp mode Transparentor(config)#vtp mode Client</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>then, set the domain</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>(config)#vtp domain CISCO</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This will put the switch in client mode and on the same domain as the VTP server. Allowing it to accept VLAN configs from the core or Firewall. If you run into an MD5 digest checksum mismatch error, you may need to change the password on all devices in the same domain that need VTP configs, like this: </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>(config)#vtp password cisco</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You will then want to issue the below command to show the current status: </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>#show vtp statusSw1&gt;sh vtp statusVTP Version capable             : 1 to 3VTP version running             : 1VTP Domain Name                 : CISCOVTP Pruning Mode                : DisabledVTP Traps Generation            : DisabledDevice ID                       : aabb.cc00.1200Configuration last modified by 0.0.0.0 at 7-5-19 23:13:37Local updater ID is 0.0.0.0 (no valid interface found)Feature VLAN:--------------VTP Operating Mode                : ServerMaximum VLANs supported locally   : 1005Number of existing VLANs          : 9Configuration Revision            : 0MD5 digest                        : 0x87 0x6A 0xFA 0xCB 0xD3 0x27 0xDF 0x0C                                    0x04 0xF4 0x94 0x8E 0x18 0xEA 0xE9 0x84</code></pre>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>How I used it: </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In todays lab, we will use CDP Neighbor commands to determine which devices are directly connected to the MainDistribution switch from within the CLI of the MainDistribution.  It's obvious that the AccessLayer switch and the EdgeRouter are directly connected, however, we are not always working in lab environments. In a real world application, the AccessLayer switch may be several hundred feet away. Understanding CDP Neighbor commands will help us determine the exact adjacently attached devices that we have in our network. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To start, I started all of my network devices. Once booted, I decided to login and run the CDP Neighbor command</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>#show cdp neighbors</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":281} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><figure class="wp-image-281"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/image.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/responsive/image-xs.png 300w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/responsive/image-sm.png 480w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/responsive/image-md.png 768w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/responsive/image-lg.png 1024w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/responsive/image-xl.png 1360w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/responsive/image-2xl.png 1600w"  alt=""></figure></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>From here you can see the "Local Intrfce" and the "Port ID". The Local Interface identifies the current switch that you are currently working on and the port that is locally attached to the remote device. The Port ID identifies the remote device port number. So, MainDistribution (Gig 02 from the "Local Intrfce") is directly connected to the AccessLayer (Gig2/1 from the Port ID) switch. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now, you may be asking, how do you know that the adjacent device is the "AccessLayer"? Well, based on the previous image, you cannot unless you know the environment very well. Let me explain. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The "Device ID" column shows the adjacent device "Hostname". If the hostname is configured and you understand the name, then you will be able to identify the adjacent switch. Take a look: </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":280} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><figure class="wp-image-280"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/image.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/responsive/image-xs.png 300w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/responsive/image-sm.png 480w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/responsive/image-md.png 768w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/responsive/image-lg.png 1024w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/responsive/image-xl.png 1360w ,https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/posts/35/responsive/image-2xl.png 1600w"  alt=""></figure></figure>
<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I changed the hostname of the adjacent device so that you can see the difference between screenshots. In my first image, the Device ID said "Switch", which is the default hostname. Since I changed it, you can now see "AccessLayer" as the Device ID for the connected device. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now that you can identify the adjacent device, the local port number and the adjacent port number, we can now spend some time to understand the "Holdtme" column and what to do if the CDP command isn't showing anything. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>"Holdtme" means Hold Time, this is the length of time that the switch will hold that information before it discards it. You can use the following command to specify the time (Default = 180s). (Think "Time To Live") </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>(config)#CDP holdtime &lt;60&gt;</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I personally prefer the shorter times, but if you have a ton of management traffic, you can cause CPU/RAM overload... You can always set the time when you are troubleshooting and reset it when you're done. <br>Finally, if CDP neighbors is not working, you may need to enable it on your devices. This is a very easy command.  </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>(config)#CDP enable</code></pre>

<p>I drove 45 minutes to work (yep, I commute)... Upon arrival, I decided to get my priorities straight, so I started Spotify and played by favorite playlist (lots of hip-hop) of aggressive music.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I then started to TSHOOT by logging into Meraki &gt; Wireless &gt; Monitor &gt; Access Points where I confirmed if any errors were still populating. They were.</p>

<p>I immediately decided that I needed to verify if I added/removed any devices from my network by matching up the dates from when the alerting started and my ticket queue. We decommissioned a few network devices, but we made zero network changes.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Phase II, I RDP'd into my DHCP and DNS server to validate the AP IP addresses. All checked out. I then reviewed DHCP for any "Bad Addresses". I had 50+ "Bad Addresses"... Yeah, that's an issue. They were all on the same VLAN (20) that Meraki was claiming DHCP failures on (5/5 transmit failures on VLAN 20).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Okay, so I deleted the "Bad Addresses" since nobody was on campus just to see if we had a stuck entry or caching issue. Most of the IP entries did not come back online. Great. Moving on.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Phase III, I panned over to my DNS server. Wow, okay, I have a lot of clean up that I need to do... PTR entries from 2016!! Okay, I'll delete most of those entries (since I knew that they were not needed). Checked AP status, we're almost there, I'm starting to see AP's come online.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I then decide to go back to DHCP and refresh the lists to see if any entries have been updated. Welp, there she was... ap0016xx.domain.com with a VLAN 20 ip address... I don't know about you, but I don't put my access points on access vlans. AP's belong on the network VLANs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I take the device name and search Meraki, bing! It pops up immediately with a conflicting IP address! I trace the source port and disable the switchport. The AP goes offline. I refresh my Meraki dashboard and continue to delete the remaining "Bad Addresses" from my DHCP.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Success! All AP's are online.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I then, physically, traced down the rogue AP in my environment and found that it was coming from our intern VLAN with a DHCP and Print server on it... The dated DNS records was giving our intern server an old Cisco AP name! Several things happened here that could have prevented this issue, however, it was a great reminder that we must stick to our "Maintenance" schedules and keep our network as clean as possible with regular updates and checks of all systems.</p>
