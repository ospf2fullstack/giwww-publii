I grab my coffee, sat down at your desk and logged my PC.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I was feeling confident, started studying my CCNP, felt like I knew my environment like it was the back of my hand, so I launched SuperPutty, configured my sessions (10.2.2.75) over SSHv2. I proceed to show my current interface status:</p><p></p><p></p><pre class="wp-block-code"><code>#show interface status<restore-line-break>From here, I saw that there were several updates that needed to be done.</restore-line-break></code></pre><p></p><p></p><p>Performing the <em>show interface status </em>command showed that I had several things that needed to be updated. To list a few: out of date descriptions, port-channel groups on non-redundant switchports, dated hostname, and various open ports that should be disabled.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So, I address the quick and dirty: renamed switchport descriptions, disabled unused ports, changed down ports to an arbitrary VLAN # in the event that it did come back online, and fixed my "archive" link that automatically backed up my config to a local tftp server. I know, I should be using SFTP, but I don't know how to! Teach me.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Moving forward, I wanted to tackle the port-channels. I log into both switches (Core and the adjacent switch) and proceed to remove the fiber uplinks from the assigned channel-groups. Well, I started with the core...</p><p></p><p></p><p>That was a mistake, it completely threw my switches into error state. It's now 8AM, students are rolling in and teachers are starting to check students into our Student Information System (SIS).</p><p></p><p></p><p>Then, all phones go offline, my primary DC (domain controller), goes offline, printers aren't working and several people are calling me to tell me that the internet is not working!</p><p></p><p></p><p>It's because I blocked Google. ahahaha, Just kidding.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I quickly realized that the switchports originally configured are now in errdisable state! I oofed! First off, I should have waited until the end of the day to make these changes so that this sort of thing can be mitigated without causing a service outage. Second off, I needed to be in two places at once so that I could cycle both ports, prevent loops, and then verify that they were both up and running but I was alone. My colleague was still on his way in for the day.</p><p></p><p></p><p>After several minutes of frustration, running back and forth on an 18-acre campus, I finally did it. I cycled the ports, waited two minutes for the entire core to come online (I did a full restart) - we were finally online. I then had to test the DC to make sure it was happy, pinged the phone system and validated that the printers were operational again.</p><p></p><p></p><p>We were back online after 15 minutes of outage due to my stupidity. Reflecting on my ID-10-T error, I realized that I should have waited until the end of the day, notified my head master that I wanted to make the changes, scheduled the change and then proceeded to a planned change. Remember to stay humble and grounded. You can prevent these mistakes.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Lesson learned.</p><p></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on October 13, 2022</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublii.garyinnerarity.com%2Fi-oofed-5102019%2F&amp;via=%40ospf2fullstack&amp;text=I%20oofed...%20-%205.10.2019" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/authors/gary-innerarity/" title="Gary Innerarity">Gary Innerarity</a></h4></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a href="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/migrated-5112019/" class="post__nav__link" rel="prev"><div class="u-small">Previous Post<h5>Migrated. - 5.11.2019</h5></div></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/5142019-ccnp-books-arrived/" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>5.14.2019 - CCNP Books Arrived!</h5></div></a></div></nav></footer></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/authors/gary-innerarity/" class="authors__title">Gary Innerarity</a></div></li></ul></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/"><img src="https://publii.garyinnerarity.com/media/website/Site-Logo-2.png" alt="Gary Innerarity" width="1580" height="876"></a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Proudly created with Publii and published globally with Github and CloudFlare.</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
